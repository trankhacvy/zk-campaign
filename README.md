# ZK Campaign

zk Campaign is a decentralized advertising platform built on Solana, leveraging zk compression technology. zk Campaign aims to address the lack of transparency in advertising programs while reducing operational costs. It provides a transparent solution for both advertisers and affiliates.

## How It Works:

Advertisers create a campaign and deposit the desired funds for the campaign.
Advertisers add the affiliates they want to promote their campaign.
Affiliates generate their unique links and share them with their followers.
When the campaign ends, affiliates can withdraw their rewards based on the number of clicks they receive.

## Why zk Compression?
We use zk compression to reduce on-chain storage costs. All data, such as campaign details and affiliate information, is stored in compressed accounts, which helps reduce the operational costs of a campaign.
